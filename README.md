Snakey2023 Game:

  What sets Snakey2023 apart is its innovative gameplay in a different dimension. The game revolves around a dice with values ranging from -3 to 3. Players start from position 0 and, upon rolling the dice, move forward with positive values or backward with negative values. 🎲📈📉
  
  But here's where it gets interesting! The game board is designed to span from -50 to 50, with the objective of reaching either 50 or -50 from the starting point of 0. Along the way, you'll encounter numerous snakes and ladders, defying expectations by behaving in the opposite direction. 🐍🪜🪂
  
  One crucial rule to keep in mind is the "Dice Biasing." When your position exceeds 40, a dice throw yielding a negative value is converted to its positive counterpart. Conversely, if your position falls below -40, a dice throw yielding a positive value is converted to its negative counterpart. It adds a challenging twist to the game! ⚖️🎯

Note:
  I provide both the source code and the .exe file, giving you the flexibility to choose whichever option you prefer. If you opt for the .exe application, you will need to follow a few installation steps. 
  Download the .exe file into a separate folder.
  Go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection. Under Virus & threat protection settings, select Manage settings, and then under Exclusions, select Add or remove exclusions. Select Add an exclusion, and then select from files, folders, file types, or process.
  Execute the .exe file.
  *I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the occasional unresponsiveness of the application. To mitigate this issue, you have the flexibility to modify the coin coordinates in the source code. However, please note that the application performs optimally on a display resolution of 1600x900. Thank you for your understanding. Furthermore, I'd like to inform you that we have plans underway to develop a responsive Python application in the near future. Stay tuned for updates as we work towards providing an even better user experience. Thank you for your support!
